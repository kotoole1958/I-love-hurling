                        Hurling is reckoned to be one of the fstest field games in the world. The sliothar (ball) when struck acn travel up to 60 yds, suddenly turning defence into attack.                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Hurling is a very physical game and hurleys can be lethal and dangerous weapons in the hands of a player with bad intent. It is hard to believe tht a few decdes ago, helmets were not even worn by players.

                        There are a number of teams able to compete at the highest level which gives close exciting encounters. It is difficult to fathom why ther are so many draws when a score can be achieved from 60 yds from goal and a team averages 25 scores a match.

                    <hr>
                    <p>
                        The hand eye coordination has to be developed from an early age and is is rare indeeed that it can be learned at a later age. Hence, why so many counties find it so difficult to compete at the highest level.
